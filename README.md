# CCDC-Resources

## About

This project is intended to serve as a framework for automating the hardening of CCDC Linux systems. In the event that future Cyber Defense Team generations are interested in using this, feel free to fork the repository and merge it into https://github.com/SDSU-Cyber-Defense-Team/competitions-info (or whatever repo you guys are using to host CCDC stuff on). If you wish to add additional automation, create a new `.sh` module in `modules/` and edit `run_all.sh` and `coordinate_deploy.sh` to include logic for executing it.

Created by Alexander Zucker as a project for the Spring CS 574 course.

### Problem Statement

As we learned from the 2025-2026 WRCCDC season, effective performance in this competition requires automation. The red team obtains default credentials at or very shortly after they are distributed to the blue team, and they begin leveraging them to launch attacks by minute 20. This necessitates the ability to remove default credentials across the entire environment without having to interact with each host manually. In addition to credential rotation, there are numerous other basic tasks that can also be delegated to automation.

### Functionality

On each target, the hardening sequence:

- creates or verifies the `failsafe` admin account
- verifies `failsafe` has usable passwordless sudo
- attempts no-reboot Copyfail mitigation for the running kernel
- attempts no-reboot DirtyFrag mitigation for the running kernel
- locks the root password
- disables SSH root login using an `sshd_config.d` drop-in when included, or a
  managed main `sshd_config` update otherwise
- backs up and clears root SSH authorized key files
- locks non-allowlisted local login-capable users
- removes supplementary groups from those users
- backs up and removes their `authorized_keys` and `authorized_keys2` files

### Tech Stack

- Shell scripts use `/usr/bin/env sh` as their shebang. It is important that these scripts be as portable as possible across Linux distributions and versions, so I opted for `sh` over `bash`.
- Coordinate (https://git.sr.ht/~sourque/coordinate) is used to handle remote deployment of the scripts.
  - Coordinate is written in Go, which `setup.sh` will attempt to automatically install if necessary.
- Git is used by `setup.sh` to clone this repository and the Coordinate repository.

### Components

- `modules/failsafe_creator.sh`: creates or normalizes the `failsafe` admin account,
  installs its SSH public key, configures passwordless sudo, and verifies that
  sudo actually works before returning success.
- `modules/copyfail_patcher.sh`: applies no-reboot Copyfail mitigation by checking
  installed live-patching clients, blocking future `algif_aead` loads, and
  unloading `algif_aead` from the running kernel when possible.
- `modules/dirtyfrag_patcher.sh`: applies no-reboot DirtyFrag mitigation by blocking
  future `esp4`, `esp6`, and `rxrpc` loads, detecting likely IPsec/AFS impact,
  and unloading those modules when doing so does not appear likely to disrupt
  dependent services.
- `modules/root_locker.sh`: locks the root account, clears root SSH authorized keys, and
  disables root SSH login.
- `modules/user_locker.sh`: locks local login-capable user accounts that are not on an
  allowlist, removes supplementary groups, and backs up/removes their SSH
  authorized key files.
- `run_all.sh`: host-side runner that executes the bundled hardening scripts in
  the intended order.
- `deploy/coordinate_deploy.sh`: Coordinate deployment wrapper for concurrent
  remote execution.
- `setup.sh`: operator-box bootstrap script that installs Coordinate
  and clones this repository.

## Remote Deployment With Coordinate

1. On the operator box, run the bootstrap script:

   ```sh
   sh ./setup.sh
   ```

   If you are starting from a clean machine and do not have this repo yet, fetch
   and run the script directly:

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocomX1/CCDC-Resources/main/setup.sh | sh
   ```

   The script installs missing `git`/Go build dependencies where supported,
   builds Coordinate into `/usr/local/bin` when root/sudo is available, and
   clones this repo to `$HOME/CCDC-Resources`. If it cannot use a system binary
   directory, it falls back to `$HOME/.local/bin`.

2. Enter the resources repo:

   ```sh
   cd "$HOME/CCDC-Resources"
   ```

3. Edit `deploy/allowlist.txt` so it contains the authorized/PCR accounts for the
   target systems.
4. Edit the global variable `PUBKEY=` in `modules/failsafe_creator.sh`. This is the public key that
   will be used for `failsafe` authentication. DO NOT FORGET TO SET THIS, OR YOU WILL HAVE A VERY BAD TIME.
   The script fails if the resulting `failsafe` account cannot use sudo non-interactively.
5. Make sure Coordinate is available:

   ```sh
   coordinate -h
   ```

   If the script used the `$HOME/.local/bin` fallback and `coordinate` is not
   found in the current terminal, run:

   ```sh
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   The setup script also adds this local PATH entry to `$HOME/.profile` for
   future shells when the fallback path is used.

6. Run Coordinate. If prompting for the root password causes problems, specify
   the password by adding `-p <password>` to the command.

   ```sh
   coordinate -y -t <targets> -u root -T 90 deploy/coordinate_deploy.sh
   ```

   Optional hardening flags can be passed after the deployment wrapper. For
   example, to force DirtyFrag module unloading even when IPsec/AFS use is
   detected:

   ```sh
   coordinate -y -t <targets> -u root -T 90 deploy/coordinate_deploy.sh --dirtyfrag-force
   ```

   Use `./run_all.sh -h` to view all optional hardening flags for the deployment wrapper.

### Notes

You can target individual hosts, ranges, CIDRs, or hostnames:

```sh
coordinate -y -t 10.0.0.5,10.0.0.10-10.0.0.20,web01 -u root -T 90 deploy/coordinate_deploy.sh
```

The Coordinate wrapper creates `/tmp/ccdc` on each target, drops the runner,
modules, and allowlist there, then runs:

```sh
sh /tmp/ccdc/run_all.sh <options> /tmp/ccdc/allowlist.txt
```

## Local Usage

In the event that remote deployment via Coordinate fails, it is still possible to
execute the scripts locally on each host.

1. Edit `deploy/allowlist.txt` so it contains the authorized/PCR accounts for
   the target system.

2. Edit the public key in `modules/failsafe_creator.sh`.

3. Run the full hardening sequence as root:

   ```sh
   sh ./run_all.sh ./deploy/allowlist.txt
   ```

   For local use, pass full-sequence options before the allowlist path:

   ```sh
   sh ./run_all.sh --copyfail-strict --dirtyfrag-force ./deploy/allowlist.txt
   ```

   `run_all.sh` executes `modules/failsafe_creator.sh`,
   `modules/copyfail_patcher.sh`, `modules/dirtyfrag_patcher.sh`,
   `modules/root_locker.sh`, and `modules/user_locker.sh --yes` in that order.

4. To run a specific module:

   ```sh
   sh ./modules/<module>.sh [options]
   ```

   Use `sh ./modules/<module>.sh -h` to view options for any module.

## Adding New Modules

New hardening logic should be added as a standalone POSIX `sh` module under
`modules/`.

1. Create the module file:

   ```sh
   modules/example_module.sh
   ```

   Use `#!/usr/bin/env sh`, keep the script portable across distributions, and
   make it safe to run from `run_all.sh` as root. Prefer option flags for
   behavior changes instead of manually edited global variables.

2. Add host-side execution logic in `run_all.sh`.

   Add any runner-level variables near the existing patcher argument variables
   when the module needs options:

   ```sh
   EXAMPLE_MODULE_ARGS=
   ```

   Add optional flags to `usage()` and `parse_args()`:

   ```sh
   --example-strict)
       EXAMPLE_MODULE_ARGS="$EXAMPLE_MODULE_ARGS --strict"
       ;;
   ```

   Add the module to the execution sequence in `main()`:

   ```sh
   # shellcheck disable=SC2086
   run_script example_module.sh $EXAMPLE_MODULE_ARGS
   ```

   Place the module deliberately in the sequence. Account/bootstrap modules
   should usually run before lockout modules, and modules that may affect
   services should run before final user lockdown so failures are visible early.

3. Add deployment logic in `deploy/coordinate_deploy.sh`.

   Add a Coordinate drop line for the module:

   ```sh
   #DROP ../modules/example_module.sh /tmp/ccdc/modules/example_module.sh
   ```

   `coordinate_deploy.sh` already creates `/tmp/ccdc/modules`, marks dropped
   modules executable, and forwards its command-line flags into `run_all.sh`:

   ```sh
   sh /tmp/ccdc/run_all.sh "$@" /tmp/ccdc/allowlist.txt
   ```

   That means any new runner-level flag in `run_all.sh` can be passed through
   Coordinate after the deployment wrapper:

   ```sh
   coordinate -y -t <targets> -u root -T 90 deploy/coordinate_deploy.sh --example-strict
   ```

4. Document the module.

   Update the Components list, Functionality list, and option reference in this
   README. Include whether the module is best-effort, whether it can disrupt
   services, and which flags change its behavior.

5. Validate the changes:

   ```sh
   sh -n run_all.sh deploy/coordinate_deploy.sh modules/example_module.sh
   shellcheck -s sh run_all.sh deploy/coordinate_deploy.sh modules/example_module.sh
   sh ./run_all.sh -h
   sh ./modules/example_module.sh -h
   ```
